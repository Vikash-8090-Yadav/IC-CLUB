# IC-CLUB

IC CLUB stands as a pioneering platform, revolutionizing the landscape of investment management. At its core, IC CLUB is designed to empower users by providing a decentralized, agile, and bureaucracy-free environment for managing investment clubs. The platform leverages innovative technologies to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in investment processes.

One of the standout features of IC CLUB is its commitment to decentralization. Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform ensures that investment club data is transparent, secure, and immutable. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, putting control directly into the hands of the users.'



```bash
cd IC-CLUB/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface

dfx deploy file_scaling_manager --argument='(false)'

dfx deploy file_storage --argument='(false)'

dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
